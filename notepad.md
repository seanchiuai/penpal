HUMANS ONLY - DO NOT EDIT

The app allows users to create and edit documents using AI with a workflow similar to Cursorâ€™s change-acceptance system. From the dashboard, users can start a new document, which opens an editor with the main text on the left and an AI chat sidebar on the right. When the user sends a prompt or request to the AI, the AI analyzes the document and proposes edits, with each suggested change individually highlighted within the text. In the sidebar, users can review these changes and choose to accept or reject them one by one, or use a bulk action to accept or reject all suggested edits at once.
