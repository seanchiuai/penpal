# Command: /push

Stage, commit, and push all changes completed during this session to the remote repository.

Important Notes:
- Review diffs carefully before committing
- Ensure all changes are intentional and complete
- Follow conventional commit format: `type: descriptive message`
- Warn if there are unstaged changes, TODO comments, or uncommitted work to ensure no unfinished tasks are accidentally pushed
