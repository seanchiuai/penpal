# Smart Editor Feature - Implementation Report

## Overview

The Smart Editor is a fully functional AI-powered document editing system that allows users to create documents and request AI-assisted modifications. The system uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate suggested changes, displays them with visual diff highlighting, and allows users to accept or reject the changes.

## Files Created/Modified

### Backend (Convex)

#### New Files
1. **convex/aiActions.ts** - Convex Actions for AI integration
   - `sendAIRequest`: Main action that calls OpenAI API and computes diffs
   - `sendAdvancedAIRequest`: Alternative action with custom system prompts
   - Uses `@ai-sdk/openai` and `diff-match-patch` libraries
   - Includes comprehensive error handling for rate limits and timeouts

#### Modified Files
2. **convex/schema.ts** - Updated database schema
   - Added Smart Editor fields: `userId`, `title`, `content`, `isAIPending`

## Architecture Decisions

### Backend Pattern: Convex Actions with Server-Side Diffing

**Why Convex Actions?**
- Actions allow external API calls (to OpenAI)
- Can use Node.js libraries like diff-match-patch
- Proper execution time limits (30s free, 60s paid)

**Why Server-Side Diffing?**
- Offloads computation from client
- Consistent diff algorithm across all clients
- Can store/cache diff results in database
- Reduces client bundle size

### Data Flow
1. User types prompt in AI sidebar
2. Frontend calls `sendAIRequest` action
3. Action fetches document, calls OpenAI API
4. OpenAI returns suggested content
5. Server computes diff using diff-match-patch
6. Server stores diff + proposed content in database
7. Frontend reactively updates via Convex subscription
8. User reviews diff and accepts/rejects

### UI Pattern: Two-Panel Layout
- Left panel: Document editor
- Right panel: AI chat sidebar
- Mirrors familiar IDE/editor patterns
- Maximizes screen real estate
- Clear separation of concerns

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts both Next.js frontend and Convex backend.

### 2. Access Smart Editor
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/smart-editor`

### 3. Create a Document
1. Click "New Document" button
2. Enter a title
3. Click "Create Document"

### 4. Add Content
1. Type some content in the editor
2. Click "Save" to persist changes

### 5. Test AI Suggestions
1. In the AI sidebar, enter a prompt like:
   - "Make this more concise"
   - "Fix grammar and spelling errors"
   - "Add more detail to the introduction"
2. Click "Generate Suggestions" or press Cmd/Ctrl+Enter
3. Wait for AI to process (loading indicator appears)
4. Review the highlighted diff in the editor

### 6. Accept/Reject Changes
1. Once AI suggestions appear, two buttons show:
   - "Accept All Changes" - applies suggestions to document
   - "Reject All Changes" - discards suggestions
2. Test both workflows

### 7. Test Quick Actions
Click any of the quick action buttons in the sidebar to auto-fill prompts

### 8. Test Error Handling
- Try empty prompts (should show error)
- Try without internet (should handle gracefully)
- Try accessing another user's document (should deny)

## Environment Variables

### Required (Already Configured)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Set in Convex dashboard environment variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` - Auto-configured by Convex CLI
- `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` - Set in Convex dashboard (for auth)

### Frontend (.env.local)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_*****
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
```

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **No streaming responses** - Users must wait for complete AI response
2. **Limited to text content** - No rich formatting support yet
3. **Single AI model** - Uses gpt-4o-mini for all requests

### âœ… Recently Implemented (October 2025)
- **Granular change control** - Hover over individual changes to accept/reject them using Radix UI Popover
- **Full content display** - See complete document with inline highlighted changes, not just change snippets
- See `/HOVER_ACCEPT_REJECT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for complete details

### Suggested Enhancements
1. **Streaming AI responses** - Show progress as AI generates content
2. **Rich text editor** - Support for formatting, links, images
3. **Model selection** - Let users choose AI model (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
4. **Version history** - Track document revisions over time
5. **Export/Import** - Download as PDF, Markdown, DOCX
6. **AI chat history** - Store conversation with AI for context
7. **Batch operations** - Process multiple documents at once
8. **Keyboard shortcuts** - Press 'a' to accept, 'r' to reject focused changes
9. **Mobile touch support** - Tap-based accept/reject for touch devices

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries
- Indexed queries on `userId` for fast document retrieval
- Filtered queries to show only Smart Editor documents
- Real-time subscriptions with Convex

### AI API Calls
- Rate limiting handled via error messages
- Timeout protection (inherent in Convex Actions)
- Cost optimization: Using gpt-4o-mini by default

### Bundle Size
- Server-side diffing keeps client bundle small
- Lazy loading of editor components
- Minimal dependencies in frontend

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Not authenticated" error
**Solution**: Ensure Clerk is properly configured and user is logged in

### Issue: AI request fails
**Solutions**:
- Check OPENAI_API_KEY is set in Convex dashboard
- Verify OpenAI account has credits
- Check internet connectivity
- Review Convex logs for detailed error

### Issue: Documents not showing
**Solutions**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Convex is running (`npx convex dev`)
- Ensure user is authenticated
- Check database has documents with userId field

### Issue: Diff not displaying correctly
**Solutions**:
- Check proposedAIDiff is valid JSON in database
- Verify diff-match-patch is installed
- Check browser console for parsing errors

## Code Quality & Best Practices

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript support throughout
- Convex provides end-to-end type generation
- No `any` types used

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks in all async operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging

### Security
- Authentication checks in all mutations/queries
- User isolation via userId filtering
- No sensitive data in client code

### Code Organization
- Modular components (following CLAUDE.md guidelines)
- Separation of concerns (UI vs logic)
- Reusable components in `/components/ui`

### UI/UX
- Loading states for all async operations
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+Enter)
- Responsive design
- Matches existing design system

## Next Steps

1. **User Testing**: Gather feedback on UI/UX
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track AI response times
3. **Cost Analysis**: Monitor OpenAI API usage
4. **Feature Expansion**: Implement suggested enhancements
5. **Documentation**: Create user guide and API docs

## Conclusion

The Smart Editor feature is fully implemented and ready for testing. All components follow the implementation plan, use best practices, and integrate seamlessly with the existing Next.js + Convex + Clerk stack. The two-panel UI provides an intuitive editing experience, and the server-side diffing ensures consistent, performant AI suggestions.
