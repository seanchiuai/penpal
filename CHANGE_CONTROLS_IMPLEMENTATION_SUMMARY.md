## Overview
Successfully implemented a custom change tracking and control system for document collaboration using Convex for real-time synchronization. This feature allows users to create documents, make changes, and review/approve/reject changes with inline controls.

## Files Created/Modified

### Backend (Convex)

#### 1. Schema Updates (`/convex/schema.ts`)
**Modified**: Updated database schema with new tables
- **documents table**: Simplified structure for change control documents
  - `content`: string - Current approved content
  - `title`: string - Document title
  - `ownerId`: string - User ID of document owner
  - `createdAt`: number - Creation timestamp
  - `updatedAt`: number - Last update timestamp
  - Index: `by_ownerId` for efficient user document queries

- **changes table**: Tracks all document changes
  - `documentId`: Id<"documents"> - Reference to parent document
  - `userId`: string - User who made the change
  - `changeType`: "insertion" | "deletion" | "replacement" - Type of change
  - `startIndex`: number - Start position in document
  - `endIndex`: number - End position in document
  - `newText`: string - New text content
  - `oldText`: string - Old text content (for display)
  - `status`: "pending" | "approved" | "rejected" - Change status
  - `timestamp`: number - When change was created
  - `originalContentSnapshot`: string - Document content before change
  - Indexes: `by_documentId`, `by_documentId_and_status` for efficient querying

#### 2. Document Functions (`/convex/changeControlDocuments.ts`)
**Created**: Backend functions for document management
- `createDocument` (mutation): Create new document with title and initial content
- `getDocument` (query): Fetch document with all pending changes (real-time)
- `listDocuments` (query): List all documents for a user
- `updateDocumentContent` (mutation): Update document content (used when approving changes)
- `deleteDocument` (mutation): Delete document and all associated changes

#### 3. Change Functions (`/convex/changeControlChanges.ts`)
**Created**: Backend functions for change management
- `submitChange` (mutation): Submit a new change for review
  - Captures current document content as snapshot
  - Supports insertion, deletion, and replacement change types
  - Automatically sets status to "pending"

- `approveChange` (mutation): Approve and apply a change
  - Atomically applies change to document content
  - Updates document's content based on change type
  - Marks change as "approved"

- `rejectChange` (mutation): Reject a change
  - Marks change as "rejected" without applying it

- `tweakChange` (mutation): Modify a pending change
  - Allows editing newText, startIndex, or endIndex
  - Only works on pending changes

- `getChangesForDocument` (mutation): Get all changes for a document

### Frontend Components

#### 4. Textarea Component (`/components/ui/textarea.tsx`)

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Database Design
- **Atomic Changes**: Each change is stored as a separate record with complete metadata
- **Snapshots**: Store original content snapshot with each change for conflict resolution
- **Indexes**: Strategic indexes for efficient real-time queries
- **Status Tracking**: Simple three-state status (pending/approved/rejected)

### 2. Change Detection
- **Simple Diff Algorithm**: Implemented basic string diff that finds first and last differences
- **Change Types**: Supports three fundamental operations (insertion, deletion, replacement)
- **Position-Based**: Uses character indices for precise change location
- **Extensible**: Can be enhanced with more sophisticated diff algorithms

### 3. Real-time Collaboration
- **Convex Integration**: Leverages Convex's real-time subscriptions
- **Automatic Updates**: Changes appear immediately for all users viewing the document
- **Optimistic UI**: Immediate feedback while mutations process
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching with user notifications

### 4. Authorization
- **User-Based**: Documents tied to owner via `ownerId`
- **Clerk Integration**: Uses Clerk's user ID for authentication
- **Future Enhancement**: Can add role-based permissions for collaborative editing

### 5. UI/UX Design
- **UI-First Approach**: Complete visual interface before functionality (per CLAUDE.md)
- **Consistent Design**: Matches existing shadcn/ui components and Tailwind styling
- **Modular Components**: Separated concerns for reusability
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly grid layout
- **Accessible**: Proper labels, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation
